TransientCoreDataTree

This project shows how to set up and evaluate transient relationships.  The interface shows how to use an NSOutlineView as well
as the interaction between an NSTreeController with two different NSArrayControllers.  The first NSArrayController represents a
flat representation of all the objects, while the other is used for the parent picker popup cell in the outline view.
